# ScoreCard
Converting Scores.csv file into multiple txt files. Text files contains all the information about student like marks in each subject, Gender, roll no, City,Percentage and Percentile result.
Note:This is not my complete code work,but I learned from IITM student corner portal,thanks to Janani D who wrote most of the code(I have  added percentile function and some improvement on text file content) .
